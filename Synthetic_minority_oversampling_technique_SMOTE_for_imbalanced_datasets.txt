Synthetic Minority Over-samping Technique (SMOTE) for Imbalanced Datasets

When dealing with calssification problems where one class significantly outnumbers another (like fraud
detection where 99% of transactions are legitimiate), standard algorithms often perform poorly because
they're biased toward the majority class.

SMOTE addresses this by creating synthetic examples of the minory class rather than simply duplicating existing
ones. Here's how it works:

1. For each minority class sample, it finds its k nearest neighbors (typically k=5)
2. It randomly selects one of these neighbors.
3. It creates a new synthtic sample along the line segment between the original sample andthe selected neighbors

For example, if you have a fraud detection dataset with only 100 fraudulent transactions among 10,000 legitimiate ones, SMOTE
might generrate 900 synthetic fraud examples to balance the dataset.

Key advantages:

    - Reduces overfitting compare to random oversampling
    - Improves model performance on minority class
    - Works well with most ML algorithms

Important considerations:

    - Apply SMOTE only to training data, never to test data
    - Consider using SMOTE variants like Boderline-SMOTE or ADASYN for better results
    - Combine with undersampling techniques (like Tomek links) for optimal results

This technique has saved many real - world projects where rare but important events need to be detected accurately!

Embedding visualisation techniques involve visualising high dimensional embeddings,
a crucial skill for understanding complex data representations in modern data science.

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data that capture scemantic relationships in a 
lower dimensional space. Whether you're working with word embeddings in NLP, user embeddings 
in recommendation systems, or image embeddings in computer vision, visualising these representations
can provide invaluable insights.

Why Embedding Visualisation Matters?
Embeddings typically exist in spaces with dozens to hundreds of dimensions, making them impossible
to visualize directly. However, proper visualisation techniques can help you:

1. Discover natural clusters in your data
2. Identify ourliers and anomalies
3. Validate that similar items are embedded close together
4. Debug your embedding process
5. Communicate patterns to non-technical stakeholders

Key Visualisation Techniques
The most effective techniques for embedding visualisation includes:

t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding): Excellent for preserving local neighbourhoods 
and revealing clusters

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection): Better preservation of global structure than 
t-SNE, with faster computation

PCA(Principal Component Analysis): Simple but effective for initial exploration,
preserves global variance.

Interactive 3D visualisations: Can reveal more structure than 2D plots while remaining interpretable.

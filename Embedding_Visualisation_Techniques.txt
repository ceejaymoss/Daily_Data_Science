Embedding visualisation techniques involve visualising high dimensional embeddings,
a crucial skill for understanding complex data representations in modern data science.

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data that capture scemantic relationships in a 
lower dimensional space. Whether you're working with word embeddings in NLP, user embeddings 
in recommendation systems, or image embeddings in computer vision, visualising these representations
can provide invaluable insights.

Why Embedding Visualisation Matters?
Embeddings typically exist in spaces with dozens to hundreds of dimensions, making them impossible
to visualize directly. However, proper visualisation techniques can helps

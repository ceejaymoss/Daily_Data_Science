1. Basic Linear Model
A standard lienar regression model that treats all features independently, 
missing the important interactions in the data 

2. Manual Feature Crossing
We created two critical crossed features:
sqft_x_neighbourhood:  Captures how squar footage value varies by location
sqft_x_age: Captures how newer homes command higher price per square footage
These manual crosses greatly improve model performance because they align with the true relationships,
in the data.

3. Automated Polynomial Feature Crossing
Using PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=True)to automatically generate all possible pairwise
feature interactions, letting the model determine which ones are important.

** When to use feature Crossing **
Feature Crossing is particularly valuable when:
1. Working with linear models - that can capture nonlinear relationships
2. Domain knowledge suggests interactions - exist between features
3. Vizualisations show different slopes - when plotting one feature against the target at different levels
of another feature.
4. Working with geographical data - where location specific effects are important
5. Time-based features - interact with other variables (e.g seasonal effects)

** Implementation tips **
1. Start with domain knowledge - to identify likely important interactions
2. Visualize relationships - to spot potenital interactions before coding them
3. Use automated feature crossing judiciously - it can create a large number of features
4. Regularisation - is important when using crossed featues to prevent overfitting

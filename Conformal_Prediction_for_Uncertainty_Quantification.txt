Master Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Quantification

While most ML models give you point predictions, conformal prediction provides
mathematically guaranteed prediction intervals with exact coverage probabilities
- no distributional assumptions required.

Why it's powerful:
    - Works with ANY underlying model (XGBoost, neural nets, etc.)
    - Provides finite-sampe guarantees (not just asymptotic)
    - Distribution-free - no assumptions about your data
    - Gives you exact coverage: if you want 90% intervals, you get exactly 90% coverage

The Core Idea:
    1. Train your model on training data
    2. Calculate "conformity scores" on a calibration set (how wrong was each prediction?)
    3. Use these scores to create prediction intervals for new data

The Magic:
    Even when your underlying model is completely wrong (like fitting a linear
    model to non-linear data), conformal prediction still gives you valid uncertainty
    estimates. The coverage guarantee holds regardless of model quality.

Real -  World applications:
    - Medical diagnosis: "90% confidence this patient's risk is between X and Y"
    - Financial forecasting: Regulatory -  compliant risk estimates
    - Autonomous vehicles: Safety - critical predictions with guarantees
    A/B testing: Reliable confidence intervals for conversion rates

Pro tip:
    Use different conformity scores for different types of uncertainty - 
    absolute residuals for additive noise, relative residuals for multiplicative 
    noise, or even learned conformity sores with neural networks!

    This is becoming essential in high-stakes ML where "trust but verify" isn't enough
    - you need mathematical guarantess.

# Practical Use Cases:
# Financial market Regime Detection
# HMMs can identify hidden market states (bull, bear, sideways) using observable price and volume data. This helps with asset allocation decisions, risk management, and developing regime-specific trading strategies.

# Speech Recognition
# HMMs analyze the acoustic signals of speech, where the hidden states represent phenomes and the observations are the audio features. This forms the foundation for the many voice recognition systems.

# Bioinformatics - Gene Prediction
# HMMS can identify coding regions in DNA by modeling the hidden gene structure (exons, introns, promoters) from observable nucleotide sequences, enabling gene annotation and discovery.

# Natural Language Processing 
# Part of speech tagging uses HMMs to determine the grammatical role of each word in a sentence improving machine translation, sentiment analysis and question answering.

# Anomaly detection in network security
# HMMs can learn normal network traffic patterns, with deviations flagged as potential security threats. The hidden states represent different network behaviours while the observations are traffic metrics.

# Customer behavour analysis
# Retail businesses use HMMs to understand hidden customer purchase patterns and states (browsing, considering, ready-to-buy) from observable behaviours like website clicks, cart additions and page dwell times

# Weather forcasting 
# HMMs can model waether dynamics where observations are temperature, humidity, and pressure readings, while hidden states represent broader weather patterns that aren't directly measureable

# Gesture recognition
# Computer vision systems use HMMs to recognize human gestures in video sequences, where frame features are observations and gesture components are hidden states, enabling touch-free interfaces.

# Predictive maintenance
# Manufacturing equipment failure patterns can be modelled with HMMs, where sensor readings are observations and hiddent states represent progressive stages of machine health, allowing for timely maintenance.

# Healthcare - Disease progression modeling 
# HMMs can track the progression of diseases like Alzheimers or cancer, where observable symptoms and test results are generated hy hidden disease states, helping with prognosis and treatment planning.

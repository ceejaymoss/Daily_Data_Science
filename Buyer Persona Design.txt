Key feature engineering principles for buyer personas:

1. Ratios > Raw Counts: Return rate reveals more than total returns
2. Context Matters: $1000 spent means different things for different income levels
3. Temporal patterns: How consistent is behaviour over time?
4. Multi-Dimensional Value: Not just monetary - consider engagement, virality and satifaction
5. Diversity Metrics: Shannon entropy and Herfingdahl indxe reveal shopping sophistication

Advanced techniques to try:
NLP on customer service tickets -> sentiment features
Seasonality extraction -> purchase timing patterns
Network features -> social influence scores from referral graphs
Sequence mining -> common purchase path patterns
Anomaly scores -> unusual behaviour detection

Pro tip: when clustering, use a mix of features from different categories
to avoid creating personas that only vary in one dimension (e.g only by spend leve).
The richest personas combine demographics, behavioural and value-based characteristics!

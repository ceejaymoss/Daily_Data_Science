Ensemble feature selection - a robust approach that comibines multiple feature selection methods to identify the most
consistently important features across different algorithms.

**Why Ensemble Feature Selection Matters**

Single feature selection methods can be biased toward specific types of relationships
or sensitive to data peculiarities. For example:

    . Correlation-based methods might miss non-linear relationships
    . Tree - based importance can be biased toward high-cardinality categorical features
    . Statistical tests might overlook feature interactions
    . Regularization methods can be influenced by feature scaling

By combining multiple approaches, ensemble feature selection provides a more reliable and comprehensive view of feature importance.

The Core Principle
Ensemble feature selection works by:

    1. Applying multiple feature selection algorithms to the same dataset
    2. Aggregating their results using voting, ranking, or scoring mechanisms
    3. Selecting features that consistently rank highly across methods

This approach leverages the "wisdom of crowds" principle - features that are deemed important by
mulitple independent methods are more likely to be truly predictive.

Real - World Impact
A financial fraud deteciton team improved their model's precision from 78% to 91% by using ensemble feature selection.
While individual methods suggested different "most important" features, the ensemble approach identified a core set 
of 15 features that were consistently predictive across all methods, leading to a more robust and interpretable model.

The beauty of this approach is that it not only improves performance but also increases confidence in your feature choices
crucial when you need to explain model decisions to stakeholders.
